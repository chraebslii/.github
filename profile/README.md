### personal Website

This is my personal website. It is written in **React** with **TypeScript**. It will be deployed later on **Cloudflare**. I want to learn React and TypeScript and to create my first good personal website.
I planned to publish this site in August 1st on [chraebsli.dev](https://chraebsli.dev).
