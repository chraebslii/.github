## Todo App

Todoapp is a advanced todo list app. It is written in **Typescript** and **PHP**. It is deployed on **Heroku**.  
With this project I want to learn project management and the tools Github provides for this. I also want to learn TypeScript/PHP and MySQL.

Later I want to use React and Node.js.
